## Introduction

Dear Reader,

I have found myself in State Libraries on several occasions. In general, I suspect librarians exist to serve at the minimal level of efficiency that they can get away with. On rare occasions they can be thoroughly helpful -- even happy to help. I wandered into the Tasmanian State Library during a typically bleak mid-August Hobart day in 2016. On a lark, in the interest of killing time before hotel check-in, and out of my own interest, I conducted a search of their catalogue to see if they had in their collection any articles pertaining to The Boys' Brigade. They had several issues of the News Bulletin produced by the erstwhile Tasmanian State Council from 1987-1988. I requested the items from the front desk, and waited a few hours for them to be delivered from onsite storage, and after signing in to the reading room, I devoured the bulletins. I was lost in the vibrant, not too distant past of a formerly virile Brigade council that by the latest available statistics consists of two companies; forty-nine boys; and eight officers, where in 1981 there were fourteen companies; three-hundred and eighty-five boys; and seventy officers. As secretary of The Boys' Brigade Victoria I've been interested in stats and figures; trends positive and negative. While my graphs show that we're on the right side of a valley and the outlook seems bright on a ten-year plot, the story is different when we graph from the 1960s where our earliest record of statistics exist.

I am not a historian, I'm in healthcare, but I have seen and experienced firsthand the ways this ministry can change lives, and I'm left to wonder why we are in decline. I hope that in the search for history, we can learn of our present, and perhaps find a glimpse of our future.

For all the hard work that has gone before me, I am, of course, indebted to Michael Hoare, whose 1980 book _Boys, Urchins, Men:_ _A History of The Boys' Brigade in Australia and Papua-New Guinea 1882-1976_ remains the preeminent work of Australian Brigade schollarship. I humbly set pen to paper (finger to keyboard) in the knowledge that I am following in someone else's footsteps.
