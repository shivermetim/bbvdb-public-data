*'If in older lands where poverty in its grimmest forms crushes out everything but that deathless grip on existence, though existence were a veritable torture which makes the struggle to keep out of the grave almost instinctive, the formation of the brigades have had an almost magical effect, how much more successful should they be in a land where the conditions of life are so much more favourable.'* -Fitzroy City Press, 10_th of April 1891

## Earliest Evidence, 1st Melbourne and 1st North Fitzroy

This story begins in Glasgow in 1890. At William Smith's Free College Church Mission in North Woodside Road,

It is part of the received wisdom of The Boys' Brigade in Australia that the organisation had its roots in the 1st Melbourne company formed at St Mark's Church of England, Fitzroy, in 1890 under the captaincy of a Mr John Asche. Despite the absence of any records in the archives of The Boys' Brigade Victoria pertaining to the original 1st Melbourne company, this fact is born out in the 7th Annual Report of The Boys' Brigade in the United Kingdom. The 8th Annual Report notes that 'The Executive Committee are without any definite reports from the Australian Colonies for the past sessions.' While Brigade companies in Australia and New Zealand had ostensibly been in contact with Headquarters in London, London was 'without any definite information as to the measure of success'[^1] of the movement in the antipodes. This was expressed even more strenuously in the 11th Annual Report, where the Executive Committee in the United Kingdom expressed 'surprise that The Boys' Brigade movement, which is making such rapid progress in almost every other part of the English-speaking world, has not seemed to take hold to any great extent in Australia and New Zealand'. In a 1987 letter from then Secretary for Scotland, A. C. McLaren to the Brigade Secretary Gerald Walker in London: 'It would appear that [1st Melbourne] did not send regular Annual Reports'. It seems unlikely that the company continued much beyond its first year.

The second Victorian company was founded in 1895 at the parish of St Luke's Church of England, North Fitzroy[^2] under the captaincy of William Chisholm. 1st North Fitzroy used a blue ribbon on which was emblazoned The Boys' Brigade's anchor as a way of promoting a sense of identity among its boys, and this made the company one of the first in the world to award anything resembling a badge.[^3] This predates the First Aid badge ('first BB proficiency badge introduced') by four years.[^4] A tantalising line under 'Cricket' in the Sporting Notes of the Fitzroy City Press of 18th October 1895 reads 'Falconer v. St. Luke's Boys Brigade, on the former's ground'.[^5] The actual outcome of the cricket match is anyone's guess. As with 1st Melbourne in 1890, 1st North Fitzroy would seem to have ceased operating by 1896.

## The Ghost of Brigades Past

The sources for the early history of Brigade work in Melbourne are difficult to find, in part because the archives of The Boys' Brigade Victoria contain only information from 1929 onwards. Hoare[^6] notes that all official records of the first Australian Council of The Boys' Brigade from 1904 (when the office was moved to Melbourne) are missing. He writes that The Boys' Brigade came under the purview of the Victorian Sunday School Union, a now-defunct body formed in 1871 that oversaw the operation of Sunday schools and even operated a two-year training college for Sunday school teachers from 1876 to 1932. [^7] In 1907, the Sunday School Union had offices at 313-315 Little Collins Street – an address that when supplied to Google renders (in 2016 at least) a magnificent eight storey art nouveau. On the concrete footpath to which the building is connected, a woman in a floral-print maxi dress is ashing a cigarette. Unfortunately, it would seem the offices of the Victorian Sunday School Union are no more, and wherever they went, so too went the archives of The Boys' Brigade's first Australian Council.

So, one must be content with the small pieces of evidence one may glean from the pages of _The Australian Boys' Paper_, floundering amid such articles as _An Antidote to Deadwood Dick_ and _Should Boys Have Sweethearts?_[^8], peppered between serialised tales with names like _Stories from Heathen Mythology_; _Black Paddy_; and _City Arabs_. This was, of course, a different time in Australian history, and racial prejudice was far from insidious. _The Australian Boys' Paper_ was produced from 1898-1907 for an audience of newsboys[^9] such as the 'Geelong Try Boys' Brigade'[^10] and 'The Try Society' or 'Try Boys' Society', so named for the founder's 'belief that if a boy tried, he could succeed in whatever he attempted'.[^11]

Hoare spends some time discussing the Sydney and Adelaide 'newsboys' brigades' and the relevance they have to the later development of The Boys' Brigade in Australia, however it largely it falls beyond the scope of this Victorian and Tasmanian history to cover that movement at any great length.

In an early issue of The Australian Boys' Paper, mention is made of the St John's Lad's Brigade Healesville, founded 1896, whose Object is eerily familiar: 'The object of the [Church Lads'] Brigade ... is the advancement of Christ's Kingdom amongst lads of all classes and the promotion of habits of reverence, discipline, self-respect – in fact, all that tends towards true Christian manliness.'

The Church Lads' Brigade (CLB), today the Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade, is a uniformed youth organisation of The Church of England. It was founded in 1891 by Walter Mallock Gee who was unable to create an 'Anglican branch of The Boys' Brigade' due to The Boys' Brigade's reluctance to split along denominational lines, and the reluctance of Gee's diocesan priest to permit a nondenominational organisation to operate in his parish.[^12] The Church Lads' Brigade in Australia appears to have been replaced by the Church of England Boys' Society (CEBS), itself founded in 1914.[^13] At some stage prior to this, however, the organisation made its way to the antipodes, where by 1896 it was present in the parish of St John's, Healesville.

Later issues of _The Australian Boys' Paper_ make mention of other companies of The Church Lads' Brigade at the parishes of St Matthias' North Richmond, and St George's Malvern. It also makes note of the motto of the CLB ('Fight the Good Fight') and again the familiar Object of the CLB: '​The advancement of Christ's Kingdom amongst lads of all classes and the promotion of habits of reverence, self-respect and all that tends towards true Christian manliness.' The omission of the word 'Obedience' from the Object is explained simply, as the Object of The Boys' Brigade did not include it when the Lads' Brigade was founded in 1891.[^14] The omission of the word 'discipline' is more puzzling, especially given it was present in the earlier article. This is more likely an editorial error on the shoulders of _The Australian Boys' Paper_, not due to the CLB changing its Object.

Another issue, dated June 1st 1903, lists 'Publications Received' including '_The Boys' Brigade Gazette_'. The _Gazette_ appears to have had an impact on the editor of _The Australian Boys' Paper_, as the May 2nd 1904 issue, under the headline '_The British Boys' Brigade_', states: 'The following article appeared in a recent issue of the 'Boys' Brigade Gazette,' the organ of the British Boys' Brigade. The principles inculcated are somewhat similar to those of the Try Society…' What follows is a reprint from an article in _The Boys' Brigade Gazette_ titled 'Our Object', by Reverend Cox, which is a masterful exegesis of the Object of The Boys' Brigade.

Of note, _The Australian Boys' Paper_ contains a number of articles on Baden Powell, such as _The Hero of Mafeking_; _Baden Powell on Boys Smoking_; and _Baden Powell's Methods_, but addresses The Boys' Brigade in passing only.

Another publication, the magazine _Australian Youth_, contains far more concrete evidence of the earliest days of The Boys' Brigade in Victoria than does _The Australian Boys' Paper_. Under the heading _Sons of Australia_, the August 1st 1907 issue proclaims that _Australian Youth_ 'is now recognised as the official paper of the Boys' Brigade; and each month matters of interest relating thereto will appear in these columns.' The accompanying photographs depict a camp of The Boys' Naval Brigade (BNB) at Swan Island. The Boys' Naval Brigade was one of two 'battalions'[^15] of The Boys' Brigade, the other being more traditional or 'military' in nature. The Naval Brigade had commenced in 1901[^16] and quickly took the interest of boys throughout Victoria. The two battalions operated in unison after the BNB was integrated in 1904, however boys in the Naval Brigade added a sailor's hat and scarf over the navy-blue shirts and slacks. Each battalion had a specific focus in terms of the activities engaged in, however there was much overlap. Bands appear to have had a heightened prominence among Brigade companies at the turn of the century, and would often accompany their activities. BNB boys attending the aforementioned camp at Swan Island in 1907 were treated to 'rifle exercises and cutlass drill … together with flag signalling, ambulance work, knotting and splicing, and boat drill'. Whether some of those activities (boat drill and flag signalling) were unique to the Naval battalion is unclear, however both battalions performed drill with dummy rifles (a point of some considerable disconcertion to Dr John Paton, who in 1899 formed The Boys' Life Brigade to replace the military aspects of Brigade with life-saving.)[^17]

In 1907 The Boys' Brigade (naval and military combined) counted some two-thousand boys in its ranks 'in Victoria alone',[^18] In fact, seven-hundred members of The Boys' Naval Brigade were in attendance for the Royal Humane Society of Australasia's annual Distribution of Awards on July 22nd, 1907. They were there to 'witness a presentation of a Certificate of Merit' to Alfred Ernest Stafford, a Private of 7th Melbourne (South Melbourne), who had risked 'his life in saving a comrade at Swan Island',[^19] and for which later became the first (and only) Victorian to be awarded The Boys' Brigade's Cross for Heroism. According to the 23rd July, 1907 edition of The Age, he 'received a great ovation and a gold medal from his comrades'. The sixteen-year old Stafford had 'attempted to rescue Emil Johan Cedzich from drowning at Swan Island, on 25th December, 1906'. The specifics of what occurred on that fateful Christmas Day are absent, but the word 'attempted' says much in its silence.

On Saturday, 24th of August 1907, six-hundred and forty boys of The Boys' Naval Brigade gathered at Spencer Street for a march through the City of Melbourne. They were followed shortly thereafter by one-hundred and ninety of the military battalion, who had begun their march at Treasury Gardens in East Melbourne. They marched to the tune of the North Melbourne artillery garrison's band, who had volunteered their services for the occasion. This parade featured a demonstration, by some of the boys, of an artillery gun that had been constructed by 'Ross', the captain of the Hawthorne BNB company. If one were to create an artillery gun in one's backyard today, this would likely not be lauded in a magazine.

How then did The Boys' Brigade grow from two companies in 1901, to such large numbers in 1907? And how did the movement so completely decline by the First World War that only 1st Brisbane remained operational?[^20]

## War and Peace

The third company to be formed in Victoria was 1st Melbourne, based at The Scots Church in Collins Street, under the leadership of Rev Heyer. It lasted from 1897 to 1900, at which time was formed a 2nd Melbourne Company, next door to the Wesley Church in Lonsdale Street, at the Central Methodist Mission.[^21] Its captain was Rev G. H. Cole. The company ceased operating by 1903. The growth of The Boys' Brigade in Victoria exploded after the formation in 1901 of 3rd Melbourne at the Presbyterian Church in Lennox Street, Richmond.[^21]

3rd Melbourne was under the captaincy of David Geddes, who by 1904 found himself in command of roughly one-hundred boys. For his boys, a highlight of the brigade year was an annual camp at Frankston. In 1903, Frankston boasted a population of eight-hundred, and was home to a considerable fishing industry. The town was gas-lit, home to a 'good picnic park, bicycle track, &c', and its climate was described as salubrious.[^22] The 1901-02 camp ran at a profit of £1/8s, which was distributed amongst the boys in attendance.[^23] It is difficult to imagine such a thing occurring today. After the closure of The Scots Church company in 1904, 3rd Melbourne was swift in claiming the 1st Melbourne designation.[^24]

In 1902, a company was formed at Richmond Methodist Church under Captain J. A. Gaylard as 4th Melbourne, which re-designated as 2nd Melbourne shortly thereafter.[^25]

There were two country companies operating around this time. The first at Portland Presbyterian Church, designated 1st Portland. They had some degree of success, as Captain E. H. Alston grew the company from thirty-eight boys in 1902 to fifty boys in 1904. The second country company is representative of the difficulties that seem to plague all country companies in Victoria, as it seems to have not lasted far beyond its first year. 1st Nathalia was formed at Nathalia Presbyterian Church in 1903 under the captaincy of George Noble Elliott, but seems to have ceased operating by 1904.[^25]

Notwithstanding, The Boys' Brigade in Australia was strongest in Victoria in 1903. According to Hoare (1980), the four Victorian companies counted in their numbers two-hundred and seven out of the four-hundred and seven Australian boys in 1903. With the resignation in 1904 of the Australian brigade secretary, Sutherland Sinclair, the national headquarters of the first Australian Council moved from 73 Strand, Sydney, to the offices of the Victorian Sunday School Union in Little Collins Street, Melbourne, as mentioned earlier. Hoare notes that this had an effect of straining relations with other states besides New South Wales, born out by the collapse of the first Adelaide Battalion shortly afterwards. The strength of Victoria continued with the formation of eight new companies in Victoria in 1904, as well as the integration of Naval Brigade groups, such as the original BNB company at St Andrew's Presbyterian Sunday School in Cecil Street Williamstown, with traditional 'military' companies. The St Andrew's company, under Captain J. Cameron, was soon designated 4th Melbourne.[^26] There were other early Naval Brigade companies, including one at St Augustine's in Burwood, operating from 1902 to 1906, and one at St Kilda Presbyterian Church under C. W. Le Plasnet. It was known as 'No. 2 Company' and later 5th Melbourne, possibly changing when the BNB integrated with BB in 1904.

As indicated earlier, these Naval Brigades proved exceptionally popular with Melbourne's boys, easily outnumbering the military companies. There were a number of companies that sprouted in quick succession, at Albert Street Baptist Church; Ballarat; Brunswick Street; Caulfield; Coburg; Collingwood; Collins Street Baptist Church / Hyde Street Methodist Sunday School, Footscray (15th Melbourne, 1906); Elsternwick Congregational (6th Melbourne); Geelong; Hawthorn Congregational (6th Melbourne, 1904); Holy Trinity Church of England, Balaclava (10th Melbourne, 1904); Holy Trinity Church of England, East Melbourne; Kensington Presbyterian; Kew (16th Melbourne); Malvern; Melbourne City; Montague; Napier Street, Fitzroy; North Fitzroy Presbyterian (2nd Melbourne, 1904); Prahran; Preston Presbyterian; Rutherglen; Seymour (1st Seymour, 1904); South Melbourne (1907); South Melbourne Presbyterian (7th Melbourne, 1904); South Yarra; St Mary's Church of England, North Melbourne (8th Melbourne, 1904); The Scots Church, Melbourne; and Union Memorial Presbyterian.

The military companies in this period were formed at Armadale (7th Melbourne); Auburn (8th Melbourne); Burnley (7th Melbourne); Camberwell (2nd Melbourne); Coburg; Collingwood (4th Melbourne); Flemington (6th Melbourne); Hawthorn; Hoddle Street Baptist Church (3rd Melbourne, 1904); Kensington; North Carlton (3rd Melbourne); North Melbourne Artillery (9th Melbourne); North Melbourne; Port Melbourne; Richmond; 2nd Richmond and Warracknabeal (1st Warracknabeal, 1904).

These are only the companies of whom we have evidence. Hoare suggests that there must have been other companies in operation, if only 'fleetingly'. I have been unable to completely verify possible companies at Box Hill; Essendon Baptist; Heidelberg West; Heidelberg; Port Fairy; Sandringham; St Silas'; Surry Hills; Templestowe; West Hawthorn Baptist; and Yarra Street, South Yarra. Hoare also mentions a 1st Carlton, 1st Collingwood, 1st Richmond, and 1st Hawthorn. Whether or not these are the same as units mentioned above is unclear.

We can see that The Boys' Naval Brigade was far more populous than the traditional, military brigade – even in land-locked regional towns such as Ballarat, Seymour and Rutherglen, yet the military companies were still considerably active. On 22nd July 1907, the military companies at North Carlton (3rd Melbourne) and Collingwood (4th Melbourne) paraded together in Heidelberg, commanded by Captain Le Grew. The combined companies marched from Heidelberg to the Eaglemont Estate, at which they demonstrated rifle exercises and drill, 'officers and N.C.O.'s being given the opportunity of practicing words of command'.[^27] Inclement weather forced the drill to a close, and Collingwood's Lieutenant Downing taught semaphore signalling to volunteers. This was followed by a match of Australian Rules Football, after which they marched to the station and 'entrained for home'.[^28]

Battalions both Military and Naval had a significant focus on camping, as have brigades before and since. The military companies continued the 3rd Melbourne (1st Melbourne) tradition of annual camps at Frankston, while the naval companies began their own tradition in 1904 of camping at Swan Island, where 'rowing, swimming, and other enjoyments may be indulged in'[^29] and where Stafford won his Cross for Heroism in 1906.

The _Ballarat Courier_ of 1908 recounts an episode from the Ballarat Boys' Naval Brigade. Formed in 1903 by John Adeney, the Ballarat BNB was a vigorous company of some one-hundred and sixty boys in 1908. United States President Theodore Roosevelt had sent a fleet of navy ships around the world in a show of force, which became known as the 'Great White Fleet'. The Ballarat BNB, desiring to see the fleet as it arrived at Port Melbourne, requested rail transport from the State Government. The premier declined, saying 'let them walk'. Forty-eight boys and eight leaders took him at his word, and accompanied by a bugle and drum they marched the one-hundred and twelve kilometres between Ballarat and Port Melbourne in five days. The Government provided them with rail passes for the return journey, no doubt influenced by the public support the Ballarat BNB had garnered.

_Figure 1: The Ballarat Boys' Naval Brigade on their march to Melbourne, 1908. (Ballarat Historical Society)._

Hoare writes that The Boys' Naval Brigade's 1907 camp was inspected by the Governor-General, Lord Northcote, and the Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, with the Rear Admiral Sir William Creswell the 'Father of the Australian Navy' and first appointed Chief of the Commonwealth Navy. There was a sinister motive behind the inspection. Earlier that month, Deakin had returned from an 'imperial conference on military training at preparedness in the British Empire'[^30] at which was stressed the importance of compulsory military training for young men.

In the United Kingdom, much debate was underway as the government had every intention of incorporating the various brigades as official training units of the British Army, and in return, benefits from the government both financial and otherwise. Spurred a reminder from Sir William Smith that The Boys' Brigade was a religious organisation and that 'it has its own definite purpose … and regards military drill as a means to an end, and not an end in itself', The Boys' Brigade in the United Kingdom flatly refused to entertain the government's overtures. The story was different in Australia. While not a part of the Commonwealth Armed Forces _per se_, Brigade units became incorporated into the Government's Cadet scheme[^31] when in 1909, Parliament passed the _Defence Act, 1909 (Cth)_. The Senior Cadets (fourteen to eighteen years old) were 'allotted to the Naval or Military Forces, and … trained in elementary naval or military exercises, and in musketry … and shall be organized in naval or military units.'[^32]

Military fervour was already strong in Australian brigade companies, evidenced by the language used in the 1st September, 1907 issue of _Australian Youth_: '…so it is intended to set forth here the doings of these _juvenile warriors_ at the demonstration which took place in Melbourne on the 24th August last.' [Emphasis mine]. The same periodical notes that the boys of The Boys' Naval Brigade had 'the look of hardy seamen'. Hoare cites the testimony received from a Mr Francis Nunweek who was a boy at the 11th Melbourne company in Auburn under Captain Carter. The uniform was upgraded to include cutlasses which were worn on formal occasions. Drill was performed with Martini-Henry rifles, a kind of breech-loaded, single shot, lever action rifle that had been phased out of service by the British Army. The boys were trained in military tactics and skirmishing, culminating in a Military Battalion camp that focused on 'attack and defence' manoeuvres.[^33] At the Military Battalion camp in Frankston in 1907, the Australian Government provided free transport and the Army provided tents.[^34] It would seem that all Australian Boys' Brigaders were pressed into the Citizen Forces[^35] on leaving brigade at 18, for a period of eight years.[^36]

This was a time in history where the whole of Europe was poised, ready for war. The War has been blamed on military alliances, yet 'military alliances of themselves do not cause wars.'[^37] Forces beyond the scope of this book to explain were 'grinding like tectonic plates, … producing the tensions that erupted into war in 1914'.[^38] When The Great War finally arrived in Australia in August 1914, The Age proclaimed with excitement: 'DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE "THE AGE" OFFICE' and 'NEWS IN MELBOURNE. EXCITED CROWDS IN STREET. WAVING UNION JACKS' and 'IMMENSE CROWD SING NATIONAL ANTHEM. CHEERING UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT.' It seems morbid in hindsight, given that sixty-one-thousand five-hundred and twenty Australians were killed and one-hundred and fifty-three thousand five-hundred 'were wounded or gassed'.[^39] Included in the number that served were several Boys' Brigaders, such as the aforementioned Mr Nunweek, who served with the ​5th Australian Division Signals Company.

Even the churches 'spoke strongly in favour of imperial loyalty',[^40] that is, to join with Britain in war with Germany. Today we might question how a Christian ministry could become so militaristic, but the rhetoric from the Australian churches clarifies the question. In time, close cooperation with the Australian military proved 'inimical to the basic principles of a Christian movement', leading to the collapse of The Boys' Brigade movement in Australia in 1911-1912. The militarism seems to have been a direct cause of some companies' demise. In the deepest of ironies, the Coburg company of the Boys' Naval Brigade closed in 1911 when the Department of Defence 'refused' to take over the company as part of the armed forces.[^41]

_Figure 2: The Coburg Boys' Naval Brigade c.1908. (Coburg Historical Society)._

Ultimately, The Great War put the final nail in the coffin, and by 1918, 1st Brisbane alone was left to fly The Boys' Brigade flag in Australia.

The brigade movement in Victoria that ran for twenty-one years from 1897 to 1918 was fundamentally different to that which would later be formed, and which exists to the present day. In fact, in 1979 the Victorian State Council of The Boys' Brigade announced a celebration of fifty years of Brigade in Victoria. It is unclear whether they were ignoring the earlier movement, or genuinely oblivious to it. Either way, it shows how alien this movement was to the current Brigade. It was certainly at odds with its contemporary movement in The United Kingdom. In a time when the world was highly militarised, the paramilitary aspects of Brigade floated to the surface and were sharpened. Military and governmental sponsorship was accepted with gratitude, and the official publications of The Boys' Brigade triumph the military affectations of its members. This seems to have been at the sacrifice of Perhaps most tellingly, there is little mention of The Object of The Boys' Brigade in these publications. Perhaps in their enthusiasm for war, these companies and leaders forgot the guiding principles that any brigader who has achieved their Six Month Service Award is capable of reciting:

'_The advancement of Christ's kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness_.'
