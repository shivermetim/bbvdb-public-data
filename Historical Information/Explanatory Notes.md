# Some Explanatory Notes for Non-Members

The Boys' Brigade, known to its members affectionately as BB, is a uniformed youth organisation. It predates the Scouting movement by some twenty-four years. In 1883, William Smith was struck by the boredom and lack of discipline of the older boys in the Sabbath School at which he was teaching. The Sabbath School was attached to the Free College Church in Glasgow, Scotland. Smith was an officer in the army volunteers, and having no difficulty in reigning in the young men under his command through military drill (marching), he wondered if he could do the same for the teenagers in his Sabbath School. Thus The Boys' Brigade was born.[^1] The uniform was initially a simple one – a pillbox hat; a white haversack; and a brown leather belt, all to be worn over a boy's regular clothes.[^2]

The Boys' Brigade soon spread across the globe. A sister organisation, The Girls' Brigade, was formed in 1893, although several Boys' Brigade groups across the world have made the decision to admit girls to their ranks, including Australia where this is most common in Western Australia.

Individual groups of the Brigade are known as 'companies'. Each company is designated by a number, and a location. In Victoria, these were initially 1st Melbourne, 1st Latrobe Valley, etc. From 1983, Victorian companies changed this convention in line with most Australia, and companies became known as 1st Vic Armadale, 4th Vic Moe, etc. It is not uncommon for old numbers to be re-assigned to new companies, although the practice in Victoria is to do so only if the new company is formed in the same area, or if the leadership of the new company has a strong tie to the former company.

Each company is run by a Captain, and is divided into a number of 'sections'. Not all companies run all sections. Senior Section (originally known as Number 2 Section, or prior to amalgamation with The Life Boys, simply 'The Boys' Brigade') is for those boys aged 12 to 18. Senior Section is further divided into Alpha and Omega groups. Boys become Omegas in the term they turn 15. When Senior Section was known as 'No. 2 Section', Alphas and Omegas were known as 'Juniors' and 'Seniors' respectively, which may cause some confusion later in this book. Junior section is for those boys aged 8 to 12, and Anchor Boys is for those boys aged 5 to 7. Each section is run by an Officer in Charge (OIC), formerly known as a Lieutenant in Charge (LIC). Sections may be further divided into squads of boys, with a boy as a Squad Leader.

Leaders are either Lieutenants, Warrant Officers ('officers in training'), staff sergeants (boys aged 18 to 19) or helpers. Boys can hold the rank of Private, or Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO): Lance Corporal, Corporal, or Sergeant. There was formerly as rank of 'Private First Class' which could be awarded on completion of roughly half the requirements for the Queen's Badge, but this rank has been replace by the Sir William Alexander Smith Award.

The Queen's Badge is our highest award, and involves significant effort over several years in the form of leadership training, citizenship, scripture knowledge, community service, knowledge of The Boys' Brigade, outdoor education, physical recreation, skills, and hobbies.

The companies may be formed into regions, or into battalions. There are no longer any battalions in operation in Victoria or Tasmania, but Victoria was once divided into Melbourne Battalion and Southern Battalion. There are various State Councils of The Boys' Brigade, and these are largely autonomous under the guidance of The Boys' Brigade Australia (BBA).

The Boys' Brigade is now part of a world-wide network known as The Global Fellowship of Christian Youth, and BBA is part of the Pacific Regional Fellowship of the Global Fellowship, along with The Boys' Brigades in Cooks Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, American Samoa, Soloman Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu.

The stated Object of The Boys' Brigade, largely unchanged since 1883, is: 'The advancement of Christ's kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness.'
